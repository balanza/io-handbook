## üë®‚Äçüíª WHO DOES WHAT?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn‚Äôt be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team member that should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works on IO is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!
