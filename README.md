# IO HANDBOOK

The IO team handbook is the central repository for how we run the project. As part of our value of supporting the open source philosophy, the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a [pull request](https://github.com/teamdigitale/io-handbook/pulls) to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use [issues](https://github.com/teamdigitale/io-handbook/issues) to ask questions.

The idea is that the notebook will become something like [Gitlab’s](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), also some inspiration from the [Remote Manifesto](https://www.remoteonly.org/) and [Valve Handbook](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf) and [Basecamp's handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook).
